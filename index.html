    <h1>Gaming 101</h1>
    <p>A major structure of the foot; a critical design flaw, and cause for recall, of the Achilles model of Greek hero; and the primary reason why action combat doesn’t work in MMOs. The first one will come out this December and the second a year after, in 2013. Given the way things work out, I guess we're looking at late August for the pre-release patch. I was accused earlier in the week of not knowing what a gold sink is. I’m adding The War Z to my list of highly anticipated games. Now, there’s a very lore-centric reason that Turbine chose to exclude female dwarves, and it’s not that they don’t exist.

    What I do feel qualified to spend a little bit of time talking about is how your mana and spells feel before you enter a raid environment. We should just accept the fact that the game will quickly disappoint us and we will look to Blizzard to save us once again. When we finally managed to be online at the same time and chat with each other, he asked me one question: “How do you get new skills in this game?” I first discovered Lordaeron as a fledgling warrior, prone to wearing mail and even leather because I knew almost nothing about my class, while questing.</p>
    <p>While it’s sometimes tricky to figure out how tough things are, everything here drops QL 10 gear, which is the highest QL I’m aware of. I’ve previously talked about the true dynamic nature of WH space in EVE, and I want to use last weekends Op as a backdrop to sum that thought up and perhaps add some clarity to it as well. A Hurricane battlecruiser and Buzzard are on d-scan in C2a, along with a tower, but I see no wrecks and no anomalies. After that bit of shenanigans, Cool and I looked at buying another vendor set for my Shadow spec but I was having a lot of crashing issues as soon as I ported from Org to the Valley.</p>
